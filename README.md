# taxlist

The aim of **taxlist** is to provide an object structure for taxonomic lists
and a set some methods to handle the contained information.
In a first attempt (let us call it the _first weave_) this package will handle
the flat format used by [Turboveg](http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg).
In a second attempt (the _second weave_, of course) we may try to insert a
hierarchical structure to those objects.

## Updating to the last version of taxlist
You may have previously installed the R-package **devtools**.
Then execute following commands in your R-session:


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/taxlist")
```
