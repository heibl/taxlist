# taxlist

The aim of `taxlist` is to provide an object structure for taxonomic lists
and a set some methods to display and handle the contained information.
This package should be considered as experimental but we welcome any interest
to implement it or contribute to `taxlist`.

**Task One:** The first task is to develop an object class (`taxlist`) for the
import of taxonomic lists structured as _single database list_.
In this step we will pay special attention to the format used by
[Turboveg](http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg) databases.

**Task Two:** While the first task is currently in an advanced stage, the next
step will be the design of an object class implementing hierarchical structure
but accessed in a similar way as for the class `taxlist`.

Objects and functions of `taxlist` will be also implemented as part of objects
containing information from vegetation-plot databases (look at
[vegtables](https://github.com/kamapu/vegtables)).

This package has been developed as a tool handling data stored in
[SWEA-Dataveg](http://www.givd.info/ID/AF-00-006), which is managed in the
context of the project [GlobE-wetlands](https://www.wetlands-africa.de).

## Updating to the last version of taxlist
You may have previously installed the R-package
[devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) (we recommend to use the command
`install.packages("devtools", dependencies=TRUE)`).
After that, you may be able to get the last uploaded version using following
command lines in your `R-Console`:


```r
library(devtools)
install_github("kamapu/taxlist")
```

## Some examples

### Working with East African plants (on-going project)
The vegetation-plot database [SWEA-Dataveg](http://www.givd.info/ID/AF-00-006)
is connected to the species list `EA-Splist`.
This list uses as main nomenclatorial reference the
[African Plant Database](http://www.ville-ge.ch/musinfo/bd/cjb/africa/recherche.php).
An actualized version of the list may be available in the homepage of the
[GlobE-wetlands](https://www.wetlands-africa.de) project.
You may be aware that `EA-Splist` is mainly including names and taxa occurring
in `SWEA-Dataveg` and is not a complete list of the flora for East Africa.


```r
# Load EA-Splist and test the validity of the taxlist-object
library(taxlist)
load(url("https://www.wetlands-africa.de/publications/Easplist.rda"))
validObject(Easplist)
#> [1] TRUE

# A summary of the species list
summary(Easplist)
#> 3924 names for 2580 taxa 
#> 0 (0%) taxa with first name entries
#> 2 variables for taxon traits 
#> validation for class 'taxlist': TRUE

# To know, how many genera and how many families are included in the list
length(unique(Easplist$GENUS))
#> [1] 991
length(unique(Easplist$FAMILY))
#> [1] 183

# You can also get subsets and listings of all stored names for a species
Cyclosorus <- subset(Easplist, TaxonName == "Cyclosorus interruptus")
summary(Cyclosorus)
#> 14 names for 1 taxon 
#> 0 (0%) taxa with first name entries
#> 2 variables for taxon traits 
#> validation for class 'taxlist': TRUE
summary(Cyclosorus, "all")
#> ------------------------------ 
#> # Accepted name for taxon concept '50074':
#> 50074 Cyclosorus interruptus (Willd.) H. Itô 
#> 
#> # First name: 
#> none

#> # Synonyms: 
#> 52002 Dryopteris gongylodes (Schkuhr) Kuntze 
#> 52008 Thelypteris interrupta (Willd.) K. Iwats.

[Turboveg](http://www.synbiosys.alterra.nl/turboveg), for his patience and great
support finding a common language between `R` and `Turboveg`, as well as for
his advices on formatting `EA-Splist`.

Also thanks to **Federico Luebert** for the fruitful discussions regarding the
terminology used in this project.
